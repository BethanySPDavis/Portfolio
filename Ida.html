		<li>Ida is a game I decided to make during the summer holidays in 2020 after trying to use MagicaVoxel for my <a href="Fight.html"> 3rd year games project</a>. After messing with the stop motion function, I realised it would be an interesting way to make a fully 3D game in a pixel art style.
		I started work on the custom components I'd need to allow for 3D stop motion, and once I'd finished that, I had proof of concept for the actual idea. Following on from there, I started messing around with the camera.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Truthfully, I just wanted another go at making my own game. It was one of the first times I'd felt properly ready to do so, and I was feeling inspired by games I'd played around the time (Ico, Fez, Hyper Light Drifter). I also felt like it would be an interesting way to journal/diary. Instead of directly talking
		about events that were happening in my life, I would instead create metaphorical situations reflecting parts of my life. I also knew that in creating a whole load of custom components, I'd be able to more fully
		get to know unity, and hopefully get used to making these components extendable, and adapted for a larger codebase.</li>

	<li><h2 id = "how" class="project_box_title">How did it go?</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Regrettably, a few months in, I was realising the scale of work required for animation. Coupled with a few overscoping issues (trying to write a custom shader for the sea for example). The actual design of the project wasn't too hard at all, thanks to my <a href="y3Diss.html"> 3rd year
		project and dissertation</a>, meaning all I had to do was come up with the actual physical elements of the puzzles. Unfortunately though, 3D stop motion animation takes a very long time, even for such low resolution characters. I was finding after the initial walk cycles, new animations were taking
		around a week to animate and implement, sometimes more, and as I kept adding obstacles to deal with, I realised it would require new animations. As such, I took a hiatus, and haven't come back since, as the ever expanding scope for animation work meant that it was turning into a project that was too 
		big for one person.</li>

	</ul>
	<li><h2 id = "goback" class="project_box_title">If I went back?</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>The first thing I'd do is go through the animations and see what needs adding and removing, and write a more definite spec for the interaction types, which I would refer back to when adding anything new. I'd also plan for a more strict development phases, allowing things to look ugly until I'd finished
		the implementation phase, just so that I could actually see how much needs doing, rather than going into tunnel vision and starting to write custom shaders for things that only appear once (e.g. the sea). Other than that, I might see about trying to make a playable demo. The issue this game has in many ways, is that 
		because a lot of it never got past very basic tech demo, I actually don't know if this would be a fun game, simply because the majority of the gameplay exists in my head. I hope it would be, but I would definitely go back, make two or three levels (just with blocks and whatever animations I have, no 
		additional art or components), then see if it's actually worth pursuing or not.</li>
