		<li>The mixer I made is a small 4 in 1 out 3.5mm passive mixer which runs in series, based off a schematic I found online, so that I can 
		mix 4 sources into 1 output. It fits inside a small tobacco tin, and features no controls beyond the 3.5mm ports themselves, and the 
		order in which you plug them in. It’s reasonably effective, especially at being able to record from multiple sources into one device at 
		the same time, and as it features no moving parts beyond the hinges of the tin, it’s lasted a fairly long while for what was otherwise a 
		much cheaper, and more fun and personal alternative to buying one out right. It also takes a little set up to get the correct balance because 
		of the lack of control, but if the sources are managed before sending out the signal, it can be quite effective, especially considering 
		the cost/performance ratio.</li>

		<li>Firstly, for what was otherwise a hobby project playing synthesizers, cost was a major factor. Many of the available mixers were quite 
		expensive, and had more features than I needed. Even the feature free ones were still fairly expensive in a relative sense. Given that the 
		other option was recording parts separately, and this wasn’t so much a major problem as an inconvenience, my other solution was to create 
		this. Following a simple <a href = "https://www.instructables.com/Altoids-Tin-18-Stereo-Mixer/"> online tutorial </a>, and purchasing the right 
		parts turned my problem into an amusing short project which I still use every now and then, despite having since sold my synthesizers. While 
		it’s not so much a particularly complicated project, I like to think it illustrates more of an approach to small problems. Rather than paying 
		through the nose for an established solution, I sometimes like to approach an issue more creatively, and come out with something that does 
		the job as well as is necessary without costing the earth in a relative sense, especially if it requires the sacrifice of a lazy Sunday 
		afternoon, and gives me an excuse to break out the soldering iron.</li>
