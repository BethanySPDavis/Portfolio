		<li>Ever since I first played Wii Play Tanks back in 2010, I was mesmerised by the simple, yet polished gameplay. It became a mainstay of gaming whenever I went to visit a friend's house, and over the years, it's
		become a tradition. When I had time to participate in Ludum Dare 53, I decided to make my own take on this game, with a view to working on it further down the line. While not all of it was created during Ludum Dare (it used the entirety of my code from my
		<a href = "y4Diss.html">year 4 project and dissertation</a>, and I had some old code from various university assignments to recreate mechanics like the bouncing bullets), it was a great opportunity to put 3 days aside and see how much of the game I could recreate, 
		with a view to expanding further later down the line.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>As polished as Wii Play Tanks is, two things have always stood out to me about it. Firstly, as a game there's a lot of room for expansion. The mechanics are aneamic, and there isn't any room for customisation as a player. There's also absolutely no plot, 
		dialogue, or even any real context. Just the music, the players, and the enemy tanks. Secondly, it's not really all that accessible as a game. While the wiimote pointer works well as a controller for this game,
		in tandem with the nunchuck, elevating it above your standard light gun type games, it does lock this game to motion controls, which not everyone can use effectively. As such, I resolved to make my own version which would be playable using mouse and keyboard,
		controller, and hopefully eventually other input devices, such as the tobii eye tracker. I also decided my version would, in the fullness of time include all the customisation, plot, and additional content that I felt Wii Play Tanks deserved growing up.
		Lastly, the same friend I grew up playing this game with, later transitioned to playing Mario Karts 7 online with me and another friend during the Covid 19 pandemic. While Wii Play Tanks has always been our thing (and would have excluded that other friend), part of the appeal
		to a project like this is that in time, I would be able to add my own custom multiplayer gameplay, and we would be able to play remotely.</li>

		<li>As my first game jam, it was a scramble, but very enjoyable. Looking back, I spent the majority of my time
		essentially trying to complete a check list of features I wanted in the game. Mostly it was features from the original (mines, explosions, destructable walls, bouncing bullets, tanks that could and couldn't move, some sort of level system), and when I was two and a half days in, I realised
		that what I had was a tech demo. I managed to cobble together a level quickly on paper, then commit that to a single scene in unity, adding all the tanks at the same time- mercifully turning the AI behaviour on and off based on whether the player was in their zone or not. I then added a very small portion of the plot 
		that I'd initially planned, and some sound effects, just about eaking out that short game I needed to actually have anything to show. As far as voting goes, I was so exhausted that I didn't have much energy immediately after the event, and took some time away from this project (just a week or so), and after that, I found out that you had to play and
		rank other people's games in order to promote yours, so it was another scramble of trying to play as many as I could. Having said all that, I did achieve the goals I set out to achieve. I had a Wii Play Tanks-esque game submitted on time, with a fairly solid core game loop, enjoyable gameplay,
		and just a bit more plot than the original (although my limiting factor is what I could achieve in a few lines). The result is available to play in browser <a href="https://bethdavis.itch.io/tank-world"> here</a></li>

		<li>After a break, I came back to it, and continued development, adding new features. Of particular influence, I'd played Armored Core 6 soon after it released, and found that the customisation was very much in line with the sort of thing I'd envisioned for my take on Tanks. 
		I also found inspiration for the HUD on discovering short videos of Warthunder gameplay, in addition to the ideas I'd already wanted to take on board from AC 6. Since then, I've added a very detailed "smart" reticule, the gimmick being that it contains the entire HUD during gameplay to encourage users to switch on and off elements as they please. 
		I've also programmed in several different forms of vehicle ("tank base"), in the vein of Armored Core's different AC legs. My next challenges to tackle, will be "heat seaking" missiles, online play, refinement of the sound effects, and improvements to the AI. In time, I aim 
		to have a game similar to Armored Core 6 in its combination of ranked battles and main game, and Nier Automata in world layout.</li>
