	<ul>
		<li>The advanced graphics for games project involved creating a demo scene inspired by the genre of cyberpunk (the assignment was issued around 
		the release of Cyberpunk 2077). It would involve advanced rendering techniques, such as environment mapping, deferred rendering, and some 
		creativity in creating an interesting and original looking scene. The project used an adapted version of OpenGL and C++.</li>

	<li><h2 id = "how" class="project_box_title">How it works</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>While some of the finished product has a few original ideas, at least in terms of execution, for example the specific choices I made on how to choose 
		the co-ordinates and sizes of the buildings in the scene, and how I wanted the point lights to appear, most of it was built to a list of suggested 
		features. Most difficult to achieve of them being deferred rendering, which helped increase the performance when rendering a large quantity of lights. 
		Other techniques I used included cube mapping for the skybox, bump mapping for the terrain, point lights to help make the scene more dynamic, and a 
		shader which gave the ground a wet look, as inspired by Blade Runner.</li>

	<li><h2 id = "aspects" class="project_box_title">Observations</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Deferred rendering was one of the most tricky techniques to implement on the project, which many of my peers weren’t able to implement. I’m 
		reluctant to take too much credit for this however, I mainly followed suggestions on how to achieve it, and when that didn’t work, experimented 
		with reordering some of the function calls. I later found out that I’d been rendering the image behind the camera after some debugging with 
		Nvidia NSight.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li><h2 id = "success" class="project_box_title">How successful was it?</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Overall I achieved a mark of 64%, which wasn’t as high as I’d like, but considering my strengths and weaknesses, with 3D graphics being more of 
		a weakness for me, it was acceptable. I’m particularly proud of having been able to achieve deferred rendering and actually put the scene together, 
		however, the amount of time I spent on deferred rendering meant that there wasn’t a lot left for many other advanced features, which most likely 
		affected my mark in the second half of the assignment. Another issue was the automatic camera, which I had significant issues getting to work properly, 
		however, this was more of a secondary issue, and given how low of a priority it was, I don't think it affected my mark too much.</li>

	<li><h2 id = "diff" class="project_box_title">What would I do differently if I started over?</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>I’d have divided up my time more evenly between different advanced techniques. While I picked up a lot of marks from the deferred rendering and 
		presence of other aspects, I suspect my assignment contained a scant amount of actual content when compared with other students. I’d have spent 
		more time adding different object specific shaders in particular, as this would have been a good opportunity to add some more variation to the scene.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><h2 id = "usage" class="project_box_title">How I've been able to use it</h2></li>
	<ul>
		<li>While I haven’t done a lot more work with openGL in 3D since, some of the techniques have been useful in developing <a href = "shuttle.html">Shuttle Engine</a>, and did make me 
		more familiar with openGL as a whole. The most useful thing I’ve found from this assignment however, is that 3D graphics remain a weak point for me, and 
		I intend to spend more time improving my skills in this area independently.</li>
